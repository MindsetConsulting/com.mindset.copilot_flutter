# copilot_flutter

This is a simple Flutter app that allows you to add, edit, and delete human data. The app consists of two screens: a home screen that displays a list of humans, and an edit screen that allows you to edit the name and age of a human.

## Functionality

The home screen displays a list of humans, with each row showing the name and age of a human. You can add a new human by clicking the floating action button in the bottom right corner of the screen. You can edit a human by clicking the edit button on the right side of the row, which will take you to the edit screen. On the edit screen, you can edit the name and age of the human, and then save the changes by clicking the save button. You can also cancel the edit by clicking the cancel button. You can delete a human by clicking the delete button on the right side of the row.

## How it was built

This app was built in less than an hour by someone programming in Flutter for the first time with the help of Github Copilot. The originally scheduled development time for this project was 7 days.

Here is a link to a Google document that catalogues the complete Copilot conversation (prompts and responses) that were used to create this application. The document also contains a mapping of the entire widget tree.
